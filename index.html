        The Chevy Corvette has been the gold standard for U.S. sports cars for
        most of its 70-year history, and the eighth-generation model continues
        to carry on that tradition. It more than holds its own compared to other
        similarly priced luxury sports cars like the Porsche Cayman and stacks
        up well against pricier rivals like the Porsche 911 and Audi R8. I drove
        the 2023 Chevrolet Corvette 3LT for a week and was consistently
        impressed by this American icon. The 6.2-liter V8 delivered almost 500
        horsepower, but the light frame made it seem even more powerful.
        Handling was hot-hatch-like with precise steering. Although I could
        still feel bumps in the road, they were smoothed out as much as could be
        expected for a car so low slung. The most surprising aspect was the
        cargo space. The midengine layout would appear to cut cargo space to
        nil, but I was easily able to fit a folding chair and sports gear behind
        the engine. The front trunk was able to fit a few grocery bags as well.
